# Automated_skew_reduce
Function which reduces skew of pandas data frame automatically.
Having looked at Kaggle workbooks, and observed people's somewhat arbitrary application of transforms for reducing skew. I throught it would be easily automated. I am open to comments on the statistical pitfalls of this blind approach (in fact any strong insights are welcome), or edits etc.
